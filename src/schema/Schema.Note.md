### ZOD .refine()

In the `zod` library, the `.refine` method is used to add custom validation logic to a schema. It allows you to define additional constraints on the data based on custom conditions. The `.refine` method takes two arguments: a validation function and an optional configuration object.

Here's a breakdown of the `.refine` method in your `createUserSchema`:

```typescript
.refine((data) => {
  data.password === data.passwordConfirmation,
    {
      message: 'Passwords do not match',
      path: ['passwordConfirmation'],
    };
}),
```

- The validation function `(data) => {...}` receives the input data (in this case, the object with `name`, `password`, `passwordConfirmation`, and `email` properties) and allows you to perform custom validation logic.
- Inside the validation function, there is a comparison `data.password === data.passwordConfirmation`. This checks if the `password` and `passwordConfirmation` fields are equal.
- If the comparison evaluates to `false`, the validation function returns an object with a `message` property `'Passwords do not match'` and a `path` property `['passwordConfirmation']`. This indicates that the validation failed for the `passwordConfirmation` field with the specified message.

In summary, the `.refine` method is used to add custom validation rules based on your specific requirements beyond the built-in validation methods provided by `zod`.
